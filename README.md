# Mave video components

Mave comes with powerful video components for your site, to add VOD, livestreaming and add interesting features alongside your video like chat and such. To use the components fully, you will need an account: https://mave.io.

This repo is a monorepo and includes all packages for specific libraries. If you'd rather want to use mave without a framework you can check out our script-tag on our site.
